# SmartOutlet-IOT

## API

After everything was pieced together on the hardware side we need a node that receives our input and then sends the commands to our outlet/devices.

For that as I mentioned in the Hardware section [here](https://github.com/ManolescuSebastian/SmartOutlet-IOT/tree/master/HW) we need a Raspberry Pi, that will contain our API.

In this project we used as FLASK (Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework), more info [here](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
